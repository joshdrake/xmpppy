This is an empty 'master' repository.
If you did a 
git clone git://......../xmpppy
and got this instead - that means that you must do one more step:
git checkout <branchname>
where <branchname> is one of following:
    irc-transport
    mail-transport
    mxit-transport
    skype-transport
    xmppd.py
    xmpppy
    yahoo-transport

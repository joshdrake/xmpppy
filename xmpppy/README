This library currently have only a few docs (in the docs\ directory):
 - README.py - both the valid script and detailed (by the way of comments) 
   example of library use.
 - Xmpppy's home page along with another usage example.

Reading of source (at least the client.py and simplexml.py) is highly
recommended.

Debian packages can be found on official Debian mirrors under the name of "python-xmpp".

Support can be obtained via xmpppy-devel maillist - see
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xmpppy-devel
for details of subscription.

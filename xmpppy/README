This library now have no any documentation except of README.py that must be
located in "examples" directory. You can see there for some example code
to figure out how to get online and send/receive some stanzas.

Reading of source files, at least the client.py and simplexml.py files is 
highly recommended.

Support can be obtained via xmpppy-devel maillist - see

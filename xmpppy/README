This library now have no any documentation except of README.py that is both the
valid script and detailed (by the way of comments) example of library use.

Reading of source (at least the client.py and simplexml.py) is highly
recommended.

Support can be obtained via xmpppy-devel maillist - see
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xmpppy-devel
for details of subscription.

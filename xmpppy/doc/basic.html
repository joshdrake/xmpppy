<h1>Preface.</h1>
<p>I'm very poor at my English. If you see any bugs in this text - please, let me know.</p>
<h1>Basic</h1>
<h2>Introduction.</h2>
<p>This topic intended for people who want to quickly try xmpppy for a simple task - like 
writing a command-line script for sending a single message.</p>
<h2>Writing a simple script</h2>
<p>Imagine simple script that sends message to one recipient.
Example:</p>
<pre>
xsend test@jabber.org Hello there!
</pre>
<p>You do not have such script in your repository? It can be created easily with use of xmpppy library.
<br />What? Already have one? Hmm. May be you want to simplify things a bit or just curious how
to do it one more way? Anyway - let's start now!
<br />
First - we declare ourself as a python script and importing needed modules:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys,os,xmpp
</pre>
<p>after it we have to check if we have enough arguments</p>
<pre>
if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
    print "Syntax: xsend JID text"
    sys.exit(0)
</pre>
<p>after it we must decode arguments. Omitting all checks to simplify our script</p>
<pre>
tojid=sys.argv[1]
text=' '.join(sys.argv[2:])
</pre>
<p>One more non-jabber step: we have to to get our JabberID params. Presuming that all info
stored in ~/.xsend file</p>
<pre>
jidparams={}
if os.access(os.environ['HOME']+'/.xsend',os.R_OK):
    for ln in open(os.environ['HOME']+'/.xsend').readlines():
        key,val=ln.strip().split('=',1)
        jidparams[key.lower()]=val
for mandatory in ['jid','password']:
    if mandatory not in jidparams.keys():
        open(os.environ['HOME']+'/.xsend','w').write('#JID=romeo@montague.net\n#PASSWORD=juliet\n')
        print 'Please point ~/.xsend config file to valid JID for sending messages.'
        sys.exit(0)
</pre>
<p>Thew! The most complex (non-jabber ;) ) part is finished. From now on we have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>connect to jabber server</li>
<li>authenticate ourself</li>
<li>submit a message</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start:
<br />
0. To connect we must have a client instance. Calculating our server name and 
creating Client class instance for it:</p>
<pre>
jid=xmpp.protocol.JID(jidparams['jid'])
cl=xmpp.Client(jid.getDomain(),debug=[])
</pre>
<p>1. Connecting and authenticating with credentials from the config file.</p>
<pre>
cl.connect()
cl.auth(jid.getNode(),jidparams['password'])
</pre>
<p>2. We can go online now but will not do it since it is not nessessary for sending a message.
So - sending a message now!</p>
<pre>
#cl.sendInitialPresence()
cl.send(xmpp.protocol.Message(tojid,text))
</pre>
<p>We're done! The session must now be closed but since we have not registered
disconnect handler we will just leave it to python and TCP/IP layer.
All jabberds that I know handles well such disconnects.

<h3>What now?</h3>
<p>If you were impressed of how the things were done with xmppy you may be interested in
more thorough examination of xmpppy library. The &quot;advanced&quot; and &quot;expert&quot;
parts of this document is here to help you.
<br />
&quot;<a href="advanced.html">Advanced</a>&quot; (isn't writed yet) part is much like another tutorial and
describing common principles of XMPP usage via xmpppy prizm. In describes ideas that were
laid in fundament of XML handling with simplexml library, essence of dispatcher's work and
some guidelines to write more complex programs than sending a single message from command line.
<br />
&quot;<a href="expert.html">Expert</a>&quot; (isn't writed yet) part is full library API documentation.
It is structured by modules names and describes every function of every module.
